In the next task, you will be able to win money if you are quick enough. Your task is to press a button when you see the white square. On trials where the white square is preceded by a green circle, you will win $1 if you press the key while the white square is on the screen. On trials where the white square is preceded by a blue circle, you are not able to win anything, but we still want you to press any key while the white square is on the screen. The white square will remain on screen for less than 250 milliseconds, so you will need to respond quickly.
Finally, after each trial, you will see the monetary reward earned on the last trial and the total money gained in this task so far. We will add whatever you win in this task to the amount that we pay you today. No practice trials will be presented for this task, and it will include a single session, lasting a few minutes. If you have questions or are unsure about what your task is, please ask the experimenter now.
