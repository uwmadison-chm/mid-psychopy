In this task, you will be able to win money if you are quick enough. Your task is to immediately press a button when you see the white square. The white square will remain on screen for a fraction of a second, so you will need to respond quickly.
When the white square is preceded by a square, you will win money if you press the key while the white square is on the screen. When the white square is preceded by a circle, you will lose money if you fail to press the key while the white square is on the screen. When the white square is preceded by a triangle, you are not able to win anything, but we still want you to press any key while the white square is on the screen. 
Finally, after each trial, you will see the monetary reward earned on the last trial and the total money gained in this task so far. We will add whatever you win in this task to the amount that we pay you today. No practice trials will be presented for this task. If you have questions or are unsure about what your task is, please ask the experimenter now.
