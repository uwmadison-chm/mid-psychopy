In this task, you will win money if you are quick enough. Your task is to press a button as soon as you see the white square. The white square will remain on the screen for only a fraction of a second, so you will need to respond very quickly.
When the white square is preceded by a circle, you will win money if you press the button WHILE the white square is on the screen. When the white square is preceded by a square, you will lose money if you fail to press the button while the white square is on the screen. When the white square is preceded by a triangle, you are not able to win or lose any money, but you should still press the button as quickly as possible, while the white square is on the screen.
After each trial, you will see the amount of money you've won or lost on the last trial and the total money you've won in this task so far. You will receive the amount of money you win in this task in cash when you are finished with all the scans for today. No practice trials will be presented for this task. If you have questions or are unsure about what your task is, please ask the experimenter now.
