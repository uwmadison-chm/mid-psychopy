In this task, you will win money if you are quick enough. This is the practice version, so you will not win money until you are in the scanner.
Your task is to press the space bar as soon as you see the white square. The white square will remain on the screen for only a fraction of a second, so you will need to respond very quickly.
When the white square is preceded by a circle, you will win money if you press the space bar WHILE the white square is on the screen. When the white square is preceded by a square, you will lose money if you fail to press the space bar while the white square is on the screen. When the white square is preceded by a triangle, you are not able to win or lose any money, but you should still press the space bar as quickly as possible, while the white square is on the screen.
After each trial, you will see the amount of money you've won or lost on the last trial and the total money you've won in this task so far. Remember, this is a practice run, so you won't win or lose any money. If you have questions or are unsure about what your task is, please ask the experimenter now.
